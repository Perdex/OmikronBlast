# Building

Building our software is a simple process.

1. Goto either TFClient or TFServer folder.
2. Run `qmake`.
3. Run `CXXFLAGS="--std=c++11" make`.

Now you have finished building either client or 
server depending on which folder you chose. To build
the other one, repeat the process, but choose the other folder.
